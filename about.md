Hi, I'm Dipyaman Roy. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate. My interests include privacy, security and data analysis. Contributing to open-source projects is also something I'm very passionate about. If you meet me away from my desk, I'd probably be drinking coffee or telling you about how [Charlie Kaufman](https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/charlie-kaufman) movies are the pinnacle of creative expression. 

I'm well versed in Python, C and C++. Currently in the process of learning Rust. Here's a list of tools and libraries I'm well acquanted with: Bash, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Nmap, Nikto, Hydra, Burpsuite, Splunk, Metasploit, Docker, Apache, Nginx, MySQL, PostgreSQL, AutoCAD, Matlab, LaTeX, Typst.
